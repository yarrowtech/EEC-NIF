✓ BULK UPLOAD - READY TO USE CHECKLIST
==========================================

CHANGES MADE:
✓ Backend model (NifStudent.js) - All fields optional, allows duplicates
✓ Backend route (nifRoutes.js) - Simplified bulk import
✓ Frontend (Students.jsx) - Removed validation, sends all data
✓ Frontend build - Rebuilt with cache-busting

STEPS TO USE:
1. ✓ Restart your backend server
   - Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: cd backend && npm start (or node index.js)

2. ✓ Hard refresh browser
   - Press: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
   - Or: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or: Clear browser cache completely

3. ✓ Upload your CSV file
   - Go to Students page
   - Click "Import Students" or bulk upload button
   - Select your CSV/Excel file
   - Click upload

WHAT WILL HAPPEN:
- Frontend reads your file
- Sends ALL rows to backend
- Backend inserts into database
- Shows success/failure count
- Check backend console for detailed logs

CSV FORMAT:
- Must have: name, mobile, gender, batchCode, admissionDate, roll, section, Course
- Optional: email, dob, address, pincode, guardianName, guardianPhone, etc.
- Column names are case-insensitive
- Dates: DD/MM/YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If still see old errors → Clear browser cache completely
- Check backend console for logs: "Bulk import - Received: X students"
- Backend logs show which rows succeeded/failed
- All data goes to NifStudent collection in MongoDB

FILES YOU CAN USE:
✓ student-bulk-upload-template.csv - Sample template in project root
✓ BULK-UPLOAD-WORKING.md - Full documentation
✓ test-bulk-upload.js - Test script

BACKEND CONSOLE LOGS TO LOOK FOR:
