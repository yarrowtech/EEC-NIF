# Detailed Backend API File Map - Student Portal URLs

Student portal base URLs:
- `http://localhost:5173/student`
- `http://localhost:5173/student/*`
- (`/dashboard/*` is redirected to `/student/*` by frontend router logic)

Core route host files:
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`

---

## Global student-portal cross-cutting backend files
These files are part of nearly every student request flow:
- `backend/index.js` (mounts)
- `backend/middleware/requestLogger.js` (requestId/traceId/start-end logging)
- `backend/utils/logger.js` (Pino logger)
- `backend/middleware/rateLimit.js` (used in student auth login/reset endpoints)
- `backend/middleware/authStudent.js` (student token auth)

---

## Notes
- Super-admin, school-admin, parent, and teacher portals are excluded here intentionally.
- Endpoint mapping is based on current frontend calls in `frontend/src/components/*` and backend mounts in `backend/index.js`.
- `backend/swagger.js` and `backend/swagger-output.json` are referenced in backend flow but are not present in this workspace currently.
